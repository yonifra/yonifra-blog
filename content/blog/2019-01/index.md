Howdy folks!

So, here's the thing - I've thought a lot about whether or not to start a blog. It's time consuming, the competition is brutal,
and there's just not too much time for these things anyways.

So the easy way out is simply to opt out of it all together. Simple, right?

But let's see why people do end up doing blogs eventually, and some do them very very well:
1. First, it's a nice thing to think that you have a "web presence", and with a simple `git push` command you can be out
   there for everyone to read.
2. Another valid point is that when you write your thoughts into a blog-like system, you're letting your creativity blossom.
3. People that share your views might feel related to what you're saying and start following you just because you're similar to them (highly psychological, but true nonetheless)
4. You're setting yourself to some higher standard. You cannot just put whatever you want on the blog, because people will call your bluff very easily, so this forces you to check your data, validate what you're saying and overall - learn more things and actually become more knowledgeable in what you write down.

For me it started as a nice experiment with Gatsby. A quick way to get online and check a few systems at once - Gatsby + React, Netlify, and writing tests for myself, a thing that I was lacking in most of my career as a software engineer and I'm learning it now, the hard way.

If you're also in the mood to start your own blog, I highly recommend Gatsby + Netlify combo. It's super easy and convenient to kickstart your Frontend side-project this way, and you can literally do this in 5 mins.

Hey! This is a nice topic for a blog post of its own.

Take care and Happy Holidays!
