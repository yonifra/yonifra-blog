# Yonifra dev blog

This is my first try at Gatsby with React.

## Installation

```bash
cd [your projects folder]
git clone git@github.com:yonifra/yonifra-blog.git
cd yonifra-blog
```

## Usage
This is a React / Gatsby blog based on the Gatsby's Blog starter project with some design and content modifications. Also, along the way I'll be adding plugins and experimenting with cool stuff like advanced CSS, Gatsby and latest JS.
